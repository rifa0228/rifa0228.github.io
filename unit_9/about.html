				<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
				<p>I remember the exact moment I fell in love with photography. I saw a friend take an upclose shot of a skittle in class one day and my mind was blown. I knew I had to learn how he did it. My dad gave me my first camera when I was 16. It was a little pink Nikon point-and-shoot, and I took it everywhere I went. I took pictures of everything and anything and that got me to where I am today.  </p>
				<p>I eventually upgraded from that little pink camera, but I still keep it around to remind me of where I started and I will keep it around for as long as I can.</p>

				<h3>How I work</h3>
				<p>I like to meet with clients to get to know them better. To learn the little nuances that make them unique and make them more than just a subject of a photo. I like to understand what your vision is for your special day, moment, or event.</p>
